# Amazon UI Clone with Angular Authentication

This project combines an Amazon-like front-end design with a full authentication system built in Angular 18. It integrates a custom-designed sign-in, sign-out, and home page, maintaining the visual structure of an Amazon front-end clone, while incorporating authentication functionalities via a front-end (cookie-client) and back-end (cookie-server) architecture.

## Features:
- **Amazon-like UI**: The home page mirrors the overall structure and design of the Amazon homepage.
- **User Authentication**: Includes sign-in, sign-out, and authentication handling using cookies.
- **Functional Logout**: Logout functionality integrated without disrupting the cloned Amazon UI.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled to be responsive and compatible across devices.
- **Modular Components**: Angular components manage the UI and services for authentication and routing.

This project is ideal for learning about integrating authentication into a front-end system without compromising the existing UI design.
